      <h1 id="title1">What is Anime?</h1>
      <div id="intro">
        <p id="par1">
          Anime is a Japanese style of animation that can range from full-length
          movies, television series, and specials, as well as video games and
          comic books. Anime includes hand-drawn or computer-generated
          animation. The word "anime" is the Japanese word for "animation". The
          history of anime can be traced back to 1894 when a Japanese artist by
          the name of
          <span>Katsuzo Hirata</span> created his first illustrated story called
          "Takane no hana" which later became an animated short in 1917. The
          first anime production was made in 1917 by <span>Kazuo Oga</span> with
          the help of <span>Seiichi Hayashi</span>. It was an animated short
          called “Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka” which translates into "Within
          the World of Power and Women". It is an incredibly popular form of
          entertainment across the world, with many people enjoying this form of
          art. As well as being entertaining, anime can also offer valuable
          insights into different cultures.
